First, we can use the “pingall” command of the Mininet to ensure all hosts are accessible to each other.
 
Then we can review the “pcap” file to check if the packet follows the path it is supposed to be. This picture shows the 2 “ping” packets from h1 to h3. The packets are captured on port 2 of s3, and we can see the TTL equals 62 here, which means these 2 packets pass 2 hops, s1 and s3.

From the packet captured on port1 s1, we can see the sequence of 00 02, 00 03, 00 02, 00 02, 80 01, which indicates the path of the packet. 

We only send one packet, but we find two captured packet on port2, s1, it means that the packet follows the path that the sender specifies in the header array. 

From the 1st packet on port2 s1, the length of the packet is 16 bit shorter than the packet captured on port1 s1, which means the first element in the array has been pop up, and itâ€™s the first time the packet arrives s1. 

From the 2nd packet on port2 s1, the length is 48-bit shorter than the 1st packet on this port, which means this packet has passed the other 3 devices and only has one hop left on its way to the destination.
